## R Markdown (src: RStudio)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Math 2265 Section 4.1

### Load Packages

```{r}
library(openintro)
library(ggplot2)
library(tinytex)  # to knit to PDF
set.seed(2265)
```

### Short Recap

In the following, we plot the box plot of the variable `interest_rate` in the dataset `loan50`. See how R Markdown runs R code. 

```{r}
ggplot(data=loan50, mapping=aes(x=interest_rate)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Heads and Tails

We make a simulation of a fair coin toss. Recall there is an equal change of getting a head or tail. 

```{r}
coin <- c("H", "T") # define a vector consisting of "H" and "T"
sample(coin, 1)
```

Execute this cell by clicking on the green |> button. 

Change the code to run the simulation 10 times.

```{r, error=TRUE}
coin <- c("H", "T") # define a vector consisting of "H" and "T"
sample(coin, <>)
```
This will result in an error since we want to grab 10 when there are only two. We can set the `replace` parameter `TRUE`. 

```{r}
coin <- c("H", "T") # define a vector consisting of "H" and "T"
sample(coin, 10, replace = TRUE)
```

Run this a few times.

## Questions

**Question 1.** Did you get the even number of heads and tails? 

**Ans:** 

---

**Question 2.** Complete the following code to simulate tossing a coin 500 times. 

```{r, error=TRUE}
coin <- c("H", "T") # define a vector consisting of "H" and "T"
result <- sample(coin, <>, replace = TRUE)
table(result) # `table` tallies the result  
```

Run this code a few times. 

> **The Law of Large Numbers**
> As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability of that outcome.

---

**Question 3.**

The following code runs 1000 simulations of tossing coins 500 times and saves the number of heads in each simulation to the variable `num_heads.` 

```{r}
coin <- c("H", "T") # define a vector consisting of "H" and "T"
num_heads <- replicate(1000, as.numeric(table(sample(coin, 500, replace = TRUE))[1]))
data_coin <- data.frame(
  num_heads
) # it will be used in the next question
num_heads[1:5] # prints the first 5 results
```

Make a histogram of the simulations with the bin number of your choice.

```{r, error=TRUE}
print(str(data_coin))
ggplot(data=data_coin, aes(x=num_heads)) +
  # xlim(0, 500) + # to make it to display x from 0 to 500
  geom_<>(bins=<>)
```

---

### Example of an unfair coin. 

In this example, we have an unfair coin where the change of getting tail is 75%. Compare this histogram and the one you made in the previous question. 

```{r}
coin <- c("H", "T") # define a vector consisting of "H" and "T"
un_num_heads <- replicate(1000, as.numeric(table(sample(coin, 500, replace = TRUE, prob=c(0.25,0.75)))[1]))
data_un_coin <- data.frame(
  un_num_heads
) # it will be used in the next question
ggplot(data=data_un_coin, aes(x=un_num_heads)) +
  # xlim(0, 500) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=29) 
```

---

**Question 4.**

Which simulation has a bigger mean of the number of heads? (fair coin vs. unfair coin above) 
To answer this question, it may help uncommenting the line `xlim(0, 500) + `.

**Ans:**
